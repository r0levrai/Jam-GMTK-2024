The main repo for our game üçå [Cavendish's Perfect Proportions](https://r0levrai.itch.io/cavendishs-perfect-proportions) üçå, made in 4 days for the [GMTK 2024 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024)!

Rating and comments from the jam are [here](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024/rate/2901708).

This was made with a 4 days time limit, so expect some messy stuff xD

## Features

**Zoom** from the galaxy to the blood vessels, and **draw** the object to the correct size! Your drawing will be seen by **other players**, and Cavendishs will rate their **resemblance** as well with a totally legit artistic value score!

## Tech

- Backend in NestJs and TypeScript backed by MariaDB, self-hosted on a raspberry pi 5.
- Frontend in Unity and C#, exported as WebGL builds, using the new UI & input system, LineRenderers for the drawing, its points bounding box for size recognition, and a 44Mb neural sketch recogniser (Resnet18) finetuned on part of [those](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/) [datasets](https://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/) during the jam for the artistic score value and the üçå roast generation üçå.
- Art drawn in Photoshop and Clip Studio, music and sound composed in FL Studio.
- Repo initially self-hosted on gitea in case we needed more than 10Go of storage or files larger than 2Go.
