- download the `quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap/*.full.npz` training files from [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/sketchrnn)
- run `data_preparation.ipynb` after adapting the input paths accordingly
- run `training.ipynb` after adapting the input paths accordingly

this will give you a onnx model that you can embed in unity (even in web builds!)
